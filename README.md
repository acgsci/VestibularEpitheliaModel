# VestibularEpitheliaModel

Welcome to the file repository for the research paper: "Close Packing of Cells in Vestibular Epithelia Supports Local Electrical Potentials that Reduce Latency of Action Potential Generation"

**Paper Status:** Preprint available on bioRxiv (June 15, 2025): https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.14.659580v1

**Repository Status (June 15, 2025)**: Model files awaiting upload. Please check back later or send me an email.

For questions, assistance, or bug reports please feel free to contact me at: user@domain.edu ; user = ag105; domain = rice; or at: user@gmail.com; user = g.aravind.c

Newer iterations of the model are being developed, if you are interested in collaborating or helping implement improvements to different aspects of the model, please get in touch.

**Requirements:**

    The base Comsol Multiphysics software package (https://www.comsol.com/). Version 6.3 or greater
    (Optional) The Matlab Livelink addon for Comsol Multiphysics.

The provided .mph files can be opened with the base package of Comsol. Remember to compute the solution after accessing the model files for the first time. Variables of interest can then be ploted using the results section in the comsol gui.
